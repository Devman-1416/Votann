# Votann
This is a final project for my CIS 230 class. The goal was to use C++ to simulate a CPU,
have it use a variety of instructions (ASSEMBLY), registers, and my own simulated programming language
using the concepts learned in the class.

The true scope of this has no end, but the current version is thematic, has a working
memory system, and a calculator using integers.

Please look at the instructions.txt for more information related to the classes and naming conventions.

# Note
We were limited to using DEV C++ for the IDE and C++11.
